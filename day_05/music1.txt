I think of her, such a blur
Think I should go for a walk before I go berserk
Its unbelievable Hows it possible?
I think my heads bound to explode
I need to get my dose before I lose control
Shes got me shivering from my head from my head to toes
You make me high, high, higher than the skyline
Cant deny, the signs, this feeling I cant hide
Its in your eyes, your smile
I dont know how to describe the way you make me feel
Its so unreal its true
I dont know what to do
Im badly hooked on you
Shes like a drug She makes me high
Her kind should come with a label or a warning sign
Highly addictive, deadly seductive
Cuz in the end youre gonna pay forever & a day, you better keep away,
But you do it you do it anyway
You make me high, high, higher than the skyline
Cant deny, the signs, this feeling I cant hide
Its in your eyes, your smile
I dont know how to describe the way you make me feel
Its so unreal its true
I dont know what to do
Call me a loser, call me a user, this drug aint giving no hangover
Ill be the slave, you be the leader
You make me high, high, higher than the skyline
Cant deny, the signs, this feeling I cant hide
Its in your eyes, your smile
I dont know how to describe the way you make me feel
Its so unreal its true
I dont know what to do
Im badly hooked on you you you
Im badly hooked on you yeah
Its in your eyes, your smile
I dont know how to describe the way you make me feel
Its so unreal its true
I dont know what to do
Im badly hooked on you
